# Portfolio Website

Welcome to my personal portfolio website! This project showcases my background, skills, and selected projects as a Software Engineering undergraduate, with a focus on DevOps and Cloud Engineering.

## 🚀 Project Description

This is a fully responsive portfolio website developed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It includes sections such as Home, About, Skills, Projects, and Contact. The design is clean and modern, aimed at reflecting both my technical and personal identity. This portfolio highlights my expertise in cloud technologies, CI/CD pipelines, containerization, and more.

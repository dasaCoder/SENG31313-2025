### 🔄 Advantages
- **Maintainability**: Easily update individual sections without breaking the whole site  
- **Reusability**: Components can be reused in future projects  
- **Performance**: Loads only what's needed, improving speed

## 🎞️ Smooth Animations
The portfolio integrates smooth and subtle animations using Tailwind CSS and JavaScript:
- **Fade-ins / slide-ins** with Tailwind's `transition`, `duration`, `ease` classes  
- **Hover effects** on cards and buttons (`hover:scale-105`, `hover:shadow-xl`, etc.)  
- **Scroll-based reveals** using classes like `opacity-0`, `translate-y-10`, animated in with JS triggers  

These animations enhance the user experience while keeping the interface lightweight.
